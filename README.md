# Recore_Klipper_Configs

A small section of builds for different configurations for some printers that are available...

`These are config files for Klipper and some random printers w/ specific peripheral use!`

Enjoy...

`Note to self...`

- add Z_Axes and not one, single axis...

- make it known that the RepliCape for the BeagleBone Black needs specifics.
	* Some specifics: Adjust the .cfg file, Refactor 3.0.3 or before, and other ideas...

- also, the Recore for the PrintrBot 1403/Behemoth needs additional set up instructions...
	* Outside of the build, add photos, dimensions, and what may happen.

- for the Monoprice Maker Select Plus, promote the idea of the Recore and KlippyScreen.
	* I will be using Klipper and Mainsail along w/ the Refactor image 3.1.3 or newer...

`Note for others...`

- Make additions or ideas known...
- The Dual_Z steppers for the Maker Select Plus is a guess so far...
	* The second Z_Axis smashes the endstop into the bed so far...ah?

`Other Ideas...`

- The odd.jpg photo is a print made w/ the Maker Select Plus by Monoprice
- I cannot configure things correctly so far
- The Z_Axes and the extruder seem to be off by a fair bit for now
	* The Z_Axis (z1) now does not smash into the bed!
	* The Extruder motor gets hot, i.e. a little too hot for comfort
	* The print in the photo seems okay but...
		* There should be a Z_Axis maneuver needing to take place
		* This maneuver should bring the Z_Axes high while still printing
		* So far, there is a disconnect and the Z_Axes rise w/out printing the part
