# Recore_Klipper_Configs

A small section of builds for different configurations for some printers that are available...

`These are config files for Klipper and some random printers w/ specific peripheral use!`

Enjoy...

`Note to self...`

- add Z_Axes and not one, single axis...

- make it known that the RepliCape for the BeagleBone Black needs specifics.
* Some specifics: Adjust the .cfg file, Refactor 3.0.3 or before, and other ideas...

- also, the Recore for the PrintrBot 1403/Behemoth needs additional set up instructions...
* Outside of the build, add photos, dimensions, and what may happen.

- for the Monoprice Maker Select Plus, promote the idea of the Recore and KlippyScreen.
* I will be using Klipper and Mainsail along w/ the Refactor image 3.1.3 or newer...

`Note for others...`

- Make additions or ideas known...
